              Assured Rewards primarily operates as a cashback and rewards
              facilitation platform. As a general principle, transactions that
              involve reward credits, cashback validation, promotional benefits,
              wallet processing, or digital code generation are non-refundable
              once processed, confirmed, or delivered.

              <br />
              Refunds are not automatically granted and are subject to review,

              <br />
              Approved refunds are typically initiated within 24–48 business
              hours, but the actual credit to your bank account, card, or
              payment method may take additional time depending on the payment
              provider"s processing timelines.

              6. Prepaid and Postpaid Plan Policy
            </h2>
            <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
              Assured Rewards offers two operational models for vendors: Prepaid
              Plan and Postpaid Plan. The terms applicable to each plan are
              outlined below.
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>Prepaid Plan</strong>
              <br />
              Under the Prepaid Plan, vendors are required to make advance
              payment before QR-based cashback generation or related services
              are activated. Cashback credits and services are processed only
              against the available prepaid balance.
              <br />
              All prepaid amounts once credited to the vendor wallet are
              non-refundable. Vendors are responsible for ensuring accurate
              usage and monitoring their wallet balance before initiating
              cashback generation. Unused prepaid balances may remain available
              for future eligible transactions but shall not be eligible for
              cash withdrawal unless explicitly approved by Assured Rewards.
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>Postpaid Plan</strong>
              <br />
              Under the Postpaid Plan, vendors are permitted to generate
              QR-based cashback and related services first, and payment must be
              made thereafter based on actual usage.
              <br />
              Vendors enrolled in the Postpaid Plan are obligated to settle all
              outstanding dues within the specified billing cycle. Failure to
              make timely payments may result in suspension of services,
              restriction of QR generation, or permanent termination of access
              to the Platform.
              <br />
              Amounts payable under the Postpaid Plan are non-refundable once
              cashback has been generated or services have been utilized.
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>QR Generation Technology Fee</strong>
              <br />
              A QR generation technology fee shall be applicable under both
              Prepaid and Postpaid Plans as per the prevailing commercial norms
              of Assured Rewards.
              <br />
              This fee covers technology infrastructure, system processing,
              validation mechanisms, and platform maintenance associated with QR
              creation and cashback execution. The applicable fee structure may
              be revised from time to time, and vendors shall be notified of any
              changes through the Platform or official communication channels.
              <br />
              The QR generation technology fee is non-refundable once the QR has
              been generated or activated.

              In certain verified cases, Assured Rewards may offer a partial
